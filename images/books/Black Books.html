			<section class="bookDescription">Most programming languages contain 
good and bad components, but javascript has more than its share of the 
latter, as it was developped and released in a hurry, before it could be

 and maintainable than the languge as a whole - a subset you can use to 
create turly extensible and efficient code.</section>
